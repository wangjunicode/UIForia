# UIForia - new UI for Unity ... PREVIEW!
This is just a preview, we'll release a stable version of UIForia later
this year, once we're ready. Feel free to look at the current state and
get excited! The docs aren't ready and we still rely on a forked version
of TextMesh Pro (copy our forked package into your project). But not forever!
Comments, fixes or demos are welcome. We might not have time for support
right now, since we're working hard on the framework!
